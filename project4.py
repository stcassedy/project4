How the KB works so far:

The knowledge base currently can handle verbs, adjectives, and prepositions.

I did not create lists for "not" something. I figure that we can save
information in the KB as "not human", "not animal", etc.

It is easy in python to parse strings so checking for "not" wouldn't be
difficult. We can do this differently if we choose to do so.

For adverbs, I think it would be easiest to save them with their respective
verbs, so a sample verb is "moved quickly".

I am not sure the best way to handle prepositions or possessions yet. I made
space for them in the KB for the mean time.

The lists for possible options should be useful for generating questions.

The initial KB info is from my last project and open for change.
